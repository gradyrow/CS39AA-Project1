#Part 2 consisted of tokenizing the text and attempting to perform sentiment analysis, but when attempting the sentiment analysis, it refused to work with my tokenized data, and due to time constraints, I was unable to get it functional in time. May look into the research project due to lack of success and not enough understanding to work with text data, although I thought I knew how to do it.
