# Project 1
#Part 1 mainly consisted of proccessing the review text into tokens to eventually get a sentiment score. I ran into hurdles when attempting to use either lemmatization or stemming to help refine my vocabulary. Both tools were giving me some errors I couldn't troubleshoot, so I continued with the less refined vocab. The second half of the battle was sentiment scores. I had two options to choose from from my research into tools to get default scores


#Part 2 consisted of tokenizing the text and attempting to perform sentiment analysis, but when attempting the sentiment analysis, it refused to work with my tokenized data, and due to time constraints, I was unable to get it functional in time. I have reworked it now to have a functional sentiment score, and am in the process of exploring using textblob vs vader tools for obtaining a sentiment analysis without having a validated set of data to work from. Depending on my ability to further tune the model, I may look into a reasearch project to dive into if vader and textblob are very different at all, if the results turn out different from eachother.
